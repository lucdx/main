== PROJECT: ClassRepO

== Overview

ClassRepO is a desktop address book application written in Java that targets secondary schools for usage by their students, tutors and staff. This portfolio is meant to document the contributions that I made to the project.

== Roles
Under this project, I serve as the Scribe, monitoring all the documentation related to the project, thus ensuring that they are both coherent and informative.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Fees* feature
** What it does: Allows the tagging both staff and students with their respective fees and the dates these fees are due.
** Justification: This feature gives way to another important attribute being tracked in a school system.
** Highlights: This feature allows for tracking of every Person's fee in the address book without actually manipulating the addressbook data. It also automatically adds a 'Fees Due' tag to the person.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a History Command to show the history of commands inputted by the user in that usage session, so as to visually identify mistakes in past commands.
